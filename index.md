# who is this guy?
I'm an MD/PhD student at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, currently in the PhD phase of my training. I'm working with [Alex Williams][neurostatslab] (NYU / [Flatiron Institute][flatiron]) to develop probabilistic methods for neural data analysis. Prior to NYU, I went to the University of Texas at Austin (hook 'em horns!), where I worked with [Marcel Goldschen-Ohm][golab] on developing analysis software for high-throughput single-molecule data.

You can find my work on [Google Scholar][gsch] and/or read some thoughts related to computational neuroscience in my blog, [clicky clacky brain things](/blog).

Outside of work, I care **a lot** about the interplay between heath equity, STEM accessibility, and community organization. If you have thoughts/ideas or you'd just like to chat about stuff, feel free to email me at argha.bandyopadhyay (at) gmail.com.
